### This bot aims to broadcast an image or video at a precisely defined time in the script each day of the week (Monday to Sunday) in a specified telegram channel.

This bot has been customized for server downtime in case it is hosted on a remote server that you do not have control over its startup or downtime.

That is to say if it turns out that the server is inactive at the time defined for the publications of the images or videos it will publish them 1 min after the restart of the server in order to catch up.

The purpose of the configBot.json file is to know whether or not the publication was made after the server restart.
This value cannot be kept in the script itself because it would be lost or incorrect if the server was restarted.

Please enter command /help to see all available options 

Nb: you can run the script directly it will download the libraries required for operation without you having to do it manually.

please check that your folder containing your images or video does not contain any subdirectory only images or videos.
